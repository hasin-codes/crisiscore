üöÄ EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM - THE ULTIMATE GUIDE 
(Written like Zlatan would code it... because why be good when you can be the best?)

1. CORE COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN
---------------------------

A. EMERGENCY PAGE
================
// Like my bicycle kick against England, this page is a masterpiece
code - 
interface EmergencyComponents {
  MissingPersonsRegistry: Component    // Because missing people need the best search system
  EmergencyServiceStatus: Component    // Like my status - always available, always excellent
  EmergencyShelterHub: Component       // Safe spaces, like my penalty box
  EmergencyCommandCenter: Component    // Where the magic happens
  CommunitySupportNetwork: Component   // Team play, but better
}

B. DASHBOARD
===========
// The command center. Like my view of the field - sees everything
code -
interface DashboardSections {
  WeatherSection: Component          // Because Mother Nature needs watching
  MapSection: Component             // My territory overview
  CriticalUpdatesSection: Component // Breaking news, like my records
  PersonalSafetySection: Component  // Protection first, like my defense
  CommunityResponseSection: Component // The fans section, but for heroes
}

2. DATA STRUCTURES (THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE OF DATA)
----------------------------------------------

A. MISSING PERSONS DATA
code -
interface MissingPerson {
  id: string                    // Unique like my style
  fullName: string              // The star's name
  dateOfBirth: string          // When they started their journey
  lastSeenLocation: string     // Their last stage
  status: "active" | "found"   // Like goals - either scored or not
  // ... more fields in the actual implementation
}

B. EMERGENCY SERVICES STATUS
code -
interface ServiceStatus {
  id: string
  name: string                 // The department's name
  status: "Available" | "High Demand" | "Offline"
  responseTime: number         // In minutes, like my goal timing
  capacity: number            // How many can we help
  activeIncidents: number     // Current battles
}

3. API ENDPOINTS (THE PLAYBOOK)
-----------------------------
// These are the plays we'll run when we connect to the backend

BASE_URL = "/api/v1"

ENDPOINTS = {
  missing_persons: {
    create: "POST /missing-persons",
    update: "PUT /missing-persons/:id",
    list: "GET /missing-persons",
    search: "GET /missing-persons/search"
  },
  emergency_services: {
    status: "GET /services/status",
    update: "PUT /services/:id/status",
    metrics: "GET /services/metrics"
  },
  shelters: {
    list: "GET /shelters",
    capacity: "GET /shelters/capacity",
    register: "POST /shelters/register"
  }
}

4. REAL-TIME UPDATES (THE LIVE SHOW)
----------------------------------
// Because great performances happen in real-time

WEBSOCKET_EVENTS = {
  EMERGENCY_ALERT: "emergency_alert",
  SERVICE_STATUS_CHANGE: "service_status_change",
  MISSING_PERSON_UPDATE: "missing_person_update",
  SHELTER_CAPACITY_CHANGE: "shelter_capacity_change"
}

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (MAKING IT ZLATAN-FAST)
-----------------------------------------------
// Because second place is just first loser

CACHING_STRATEGY = {
  emergency_services: {
    ttl: 30,  // 30 seconds, fast like my sprint
    strategy: "stale-while-revalidate"
  },
  missing_persons: {
    ttl: 60,  // 1 minute, fresh like my moves
    strategy: "cache-first"
  },
  weather_data: {
    ttl: 300,  // 5 minutes, nature doesn't change like my style
    strategy: "network-first"
  }
}

6. ERROR HANDLING (BECAUSE EVEN CHAMPIONS NEED A BACKUP PLAN)
--------------------------------------------------------
code -
interface ErrorResponse {
  code: number          // Like jersey numbers, but for problems
  message: string       // What went wrong (rarely happens to me)
  severity: "warning" | "error" | "critical"
  timestamp: string     // When it happened
  resolution?: string   // How to fix it, like my game strategy
}

7. SECURITY MEASURES (THE DEFENSE)
-------------------------------
// Security tighter than my marking

SECURITY_CONFIGS = {
  rate_limiting: {
    window: 60000,     // 1 minute
    max_requests: 100  // Like my goals per season
  },
  authentication: {
    token_expiry: "24h",
    refresh_window: "7d"
  },
  data_encryption: {
    algorithm: "AES-256-GCM",
    key_rotation: "30d"
  }
}

// Remember: Like Zlatan's career, this code is not just good, it's legendary.
// Now go make something amazing! ü¶Åüëë
